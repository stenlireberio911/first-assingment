                One of the marvelous things about community is that it enables us to welcome and help people in a way we could not as
                individuals. When we pool our strength and share the work and responsibility, we can welcome many people, even those in
                deep distress, and perhaps help them find self-confidence and inner healing

                It’s easier to take than to give. It’s nobler to give than to take. The thrill of taking lasts a day. The thrill of
                giving lasts a lifetime.

                    life for their children and all teachers prefer motivation and achievement to apathy and failure. Nevertheless, we
                    recognize that the complexities behind generational poverty require us to be innovative and often disruptive to make
                    real learning possible.”
